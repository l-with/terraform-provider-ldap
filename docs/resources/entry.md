# ldap_entry (Resource)

Provides an LDAP entry. This can be used to create, modify, and delete LDAP entries.

Two special handlings are implemented (somehow in deviation from the generic approach in this provider):

The read function for the resource uses
[NewSearchRequest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3@v3.4.5#NewSearchRequest) to read the entry 
and thus a filter has to be specified.
Therefor `(objectClass=*)` is used as a filter not filtering anything 
(each entry has an objectClass as specified in [RFC 4512 Section 3.3.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.html#section-3.3)).

The read function for the resource ignores the attribute corresponding to the relative part (RDN) of the DN (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.html#section-2.3).
This is necessary because this part is added as attribute to the LDAP entry by the LDAP server but is not specified in the terraform code.
By now this only supports single valued RDNs (s. https://github.com/l-with/terraform-provider-ldap/issues/34). 
In the example below the LDAP attribute `uid` is ignored on read because `uid=jimmit01` is the RDN 
and the attribute `uid` with the value `jimmit01` is added implicitely by the LDAP server (although not part of `data_json`).

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "ldap_entry" "users_example_com" {
  dn = "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  data_json = jsonencode({
    objectClass = ["organizationalUnit"]
  })
}

resource "ldap_entry" "user_example" {
  dn = "uid=jimmit01,${ldap_entry.users_example_com.dn}"
  data_json = jsonencode({
    objectClass = ["inetOrgPerson"]
    ou          = ["users"]
    givenName   = ["Jim"]
    sn          = ["Mit"]
    cn          = ["Jim Mit"]
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `data_json` (String) JSON-encoded string with the values of the attributes of the entry (s. https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3#EntryAttribute)
- `dn` (String) DN of the LDAP entry

### Optional

- `base64encode_attribute_patterns` (List of String) list of attribute patterns for base64 encoded attributes
- `base64encode_attributes` (List of String) list of base64 encoded attributes
- `case_sensitive_attribute_names` (List of String) list of attributes with case-sensitive names
- `ignore_attribute_patterns` (List of String) list of attribute patterns to ignore
- `ignore_attributes` (List of String) list of attributes to ignore
- `restrict_attributes` (List of String) list of attributes to which operating is restricted. Defaults to `*`, which means 'all user attributes'. It can also contain operational attributes.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Since terraform version 1.5.x there is an experimental feature 
[Generating configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration).

### Example Usage

```terraform
import {
  to = ldap_entry.test
  id = "uid=jimmit01,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
}
```

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_resources.tf
```
